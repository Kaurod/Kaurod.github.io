				<h1>A little more about myself </h1>
				<p>I've always been interesting in design and the arts and how it can be used to solve problems. Some of my favorite fields are those that require abtract thinking. I've always been interesting in aproaching problems with a hands on aproach. This is probably the main driver for me entering the field of engineering. To challenge myself in my abilities to solve problems by trying to view the bigger picture. Some of my biggest hobbies are related to the arts. I enjoy illustrating and playing instruments. </p>

				<p>Another fact about myself. One of my biggest goals in life is to create my own indie video game. This is probably what made it easier for me to pursuit more programing courses to make this possible   </p>
